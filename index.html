        <p><strong>Matt Nida</strong> has worked on format development for <strong>ITV, Avalon, Crackit Productions</strong> and more, originating and shaping ideas with originality and a sharp sense of humour. He’s the creative mind who convinced the world <strong>Joe Lycett had shredded £10k, helped plan Al Murray’s 2015 general election campaign</strong>, and even engineered <strong>the triumphant return of Mr Blobby in a moment that went gloriously viral</strong>.<br><br>

With a knack for turning sparks of inspiration into bold, funny and memorable concepts, Matt brings fresh energy and inventive thinking to every project.</p>

        <p><strong>Matt Nida</strong> has over two decades of production experience across TV, radio, podcasts, branded content, live events, and experimental media platforms. <br><br>

He’s produced high-profile entertainment shows such as the BAFTA-winning <strong>Joe Lycett vs David Beckham</strong> and <strong>The Big Fat Quiz of the Year</strong>, bringing together sharp creative vision, tight editorial control and audience-first ideas.<br><br> 

Beyond television, Matt has overseen some of the more ambitious stunts and activations in recent years (including Joe Lycett’s infamous money-shredding stunt in 2022), plus branded content and live formats that push boundaries in both experience and impact. He's produced sell-out live shows including <strong>Rob Brydon, Lee Mack & David Mitchell: Town To Town Live</strong> and <strong>John Robins & Elis James: Made Up Games Live</strong>, and has worked with some of British comedy and entertainment's biggest names.<br><br>

His production approach is hands-on and collaborative, combining strong storytelling instinct with rigorous production craftsmanship — from format development through to post-production — to deliver work that’s both distinctive and resonant.<br><br>
